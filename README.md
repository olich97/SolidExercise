## SOLID Principles

SOLID is a mnemonic device for 5 design principles of object-oriented programs (OOP) that result in readable, adaptable, and scalable code. SOLID can be applied to any OOP program.

The 5 principles of SOLID are:

- [**S**ingle-responsibility principle](https://www.educative.io/blog/solid-principles-oop-c-sharp#single-responsibility) -> “A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software’s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.” => [SRP - C#](https://github.com/olich97/SolidExercise/commit/ee3a4700b38898ae633f629698df0a3827de57ed?branch=ee3a4700b38898ae633f629698df0a3827de57ed&diff=split)
- [**O**pen-closed principle](https://www.educative.io/blog/solid-principles-oop-c-sharp#open-closed) -> “Software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.” => [OCP - C#](https://github.com/olich97/SolidExercise/commit/82e2ffa26ddb9180132ecea8280f57b5486f3224?branch=82e2ffa26ddb9180132ecea8280f57b5486f3224&diff=split)
- [**L**iskov substitution principle](https://www.educative.io/blog/solid-principles-oop-c-sharp#liskov) -> “Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.” => [LSP - C#](https://github.com/olich97/SolidExercise/commit/2485b1a0908421a0e7dd2ce8fb8cc41ee70485e9?branch=2485b1a0908421a0e7dd2ce8fb8cc41ee70485e9&diff=split)
- [**I**nterface segregation principle](https://www.educative.io/blog/solid-principles-oop-c-sharp#interface) => “Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.” => [ISP - C#](https://github.com/olich97/SolidExercise/commit/9667adfb89c0c21174d311a1d0af166b4f3cf38e?branch=9667adfb89c0c21174d311a1d0af166b4f3cf38e&diff=split)
- [**D**ependency inversion principle](https://www.educative.io/blog/solid-principles-oop-c-sharp#dependency) -> “One should depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.” => [DIP - C#](https://github.com/olich97/SolidExercise/commit/664a986f7fb6aca10112be3106141998dabbd52e?branch=664a986f7fb6aca10112be3106141998dabbd52e&diff=split)

SOLID principles were developed by computer science instructor and author Robert C. Martin (sometimes called “Uncle Bob”) in 2000 and quickly became a staple of modern object-oriented design (OOD). The SOLID acronym became commonplace when these principles gained widespread popularity in the programming world.
